# Twitter-Topic-Modelling


``python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg``
## Questions

1. What are the different languages present in the tweets? What are the popular n-grams observable in the tweets?

2. Unsupervised Learning Modeling Task: Based on the twitter texts (TweetBody column) alone, what are the popular clusters/topics of text this group of users have been tweeting about? What are the assumptions made by your solution?

3. From the model built in Question 2, to what extent could you improve the model by incorporating additional information provided in the dataset? What the implications of doing so?

4. Build an API that can infer the topics/clusters given an input of a new tweet powered by your model trained in the Question 2 above.

5. What are the actionable business insight that can be drawn from this dataset?

6. [Optional] Design and build a supervised learning model that can predict the number of tweet favourite (TweetFavoritesCount column).
